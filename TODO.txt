To read:
* Juola monograph


To find:
* That paper about malware authorship that was mentioned in one of the first three papers Charles sent me.
* Some good benign binaries.

To code:
* n-gram program on a byte basis. - DONE!
* n-gram program on an opcode basis.

To research:
* Modelling source code as a Markov Chain
* Similarity measures/comparisons for Markov Chains?
* Determining endian-ness
* Open source reverse engineering?
** Maybe look into what Kali Linux has?
** Use this to get opcodes as a feature vector
** Discovered objdump, this is what I used.
*** But objdump couldn't read some of the files.
* If I can't find a reverse engineering thing, reading through binary correctly based on endian-ness to find the opcodes.

To analyze:
* Average co-sine score for different values of n.
* Average co-sine score for different values of n after the binaries that obdump couldn't dissassemble are removed.
