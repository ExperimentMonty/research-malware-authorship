To read:
* Juola monograph


To find:
* That paper about malware authorship that was mentioned in one of the first three papers Charles sent me.


To code:
* n-gram program on a byte basis. - DONE!
* n-gram program on an opcode basis.

To research:
* Modelling source code as a Markov Chain
* Similarity measures/comparisons for Markov Chains?
* Determining endian-ness
* Open source reverse engineering?
** Maybe look into what Kali Linux has?
** Use this to get opcodes as a feature vector
* If I can't find a reverse engineering thing, reading through binary correctly based on endian-ness to find the opcodes.
