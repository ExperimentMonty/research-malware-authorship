Abstract
--------

In the mostly anonymous world of the Internet, hackers and cyber criminals may often perpetrate crimes with little to no traces leading back to them.  Often this is done using malware that the criminal has created.  However, researchers can often obtain copies of this malware, and identifying information may be present within these binaries, even if only unintentionally by the authors.  Within this project, I expect to analyze various malware binaries using authorship attribution techniques to try to determine if there are features that can set malicious binaries apart from bening binaries, or families of malware from other malware.  We expect that there will be some identifying feature set that can be taken advantage of to show distinct authorship between files.
