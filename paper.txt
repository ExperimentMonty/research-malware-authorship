Abstract
========

In the mostly anonymous world of the Internet, hackers and cyber criminals may often perpetrate crimes with little to no traces leading back to them.  Often this is done using malware that the criminal has created.  However, researchers can often obtain copies of this malware, and identifying information may be present within these binaries, even if only unintentionally by the authors.  Within this project, I expect to analyze various malware binaries using authorship attribution techniques to try to determine if there are features that can set malicious binaries apart from bening binaries, or families of malware from other malware.  We expect that there will be some identifying feature set that can be taken advantage of to show distinct authorship between files.

Introduction
============
Since the advent of the Internet, humanity has found many ways to use it to increase their productivity, comfort, and enjoyment.  However, with all of these benefits we've reaped, some have dedicated their efforts towards undermining others by creating and distributing malware.  Anti-virus company Symantec has claimed to have detected over a million unique pieces of malware as of 2008, and the amount of malware has only increased since then [ADD CITATION].

The fact that these digital attacks can originate from any computer on the globe, with plausible deniability for the owner of that computer, being able to attribute these attacks back to the people who created them would be a useful technique for law enforcement officers and security researchers, on par with fingerprinting and handwriting analysis for attributing physical crimes to criminals.
